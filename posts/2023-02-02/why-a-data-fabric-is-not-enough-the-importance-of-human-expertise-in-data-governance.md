In the world of big data, organizations are constantly looking for new and better ways to manage their data. A Data Fabric is one approach that has gained popularity recently. It is, however, important to understand why this approach is not the best solution before diving into a technical solution like Data Fabric. 

The term “Data Fabric” refers to a technology architecture that aims to simplify big data management by providing a unified and flexible layer for data integration, management, and governance. The idea is that by using a Data Fabric, organizations can more easily manage the flow of data between different systems, reduce data silos, and improve data quality and accuracy. 

However, while the concept of a Data Fabric may sound appealing, there are several reasons why it may not be the right solution for every organization. 

## Start with Data Governance 

One of the greatest challenges with implementing a Data Fabric is ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data that is being managed. While a Data Fabric can help manage the flow of data between different systems, it cannot ensure the data quality and accuracy critical for effective data-driven decision-making. 

This is where Data Governance comes in. Data Governance is the set of policies, processes, and practices that organizations use to manage their data as a valuable asset. By establishing a strong Data Governance program, organizations can ensure that their data is accurate, secure, and used effectively. 

## Data Quality, Data Correctness, and Meta Description is a Human Task 

Data quality and accuracy is a critical aspects of Data Governance, and it is a task that requires human involvement. A Data Fabric may be able to automate the management of data, but it cannot ensure the quality and accuracy of the data without the involvement of human experts. 

Data quality and accuracy are critical for data-driven decision-making, and it is a task that requires human expertise, such as data stewardship, data profiling, and data cleansing. These activities cannot be fully automated by a Data Fabric and require human intervention to ensure that the data is correct, consistent, and usable. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, while a Data Fabric may provide a convenient solution for managing big data, it is important to understand that effective data usage starts with human expertise. Ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data being managed is a critical aspect of Data Governance, and it is a task that requires human involvement and expertise. This makes it more of an organizational change than a technological challenge. So, before implementing a Data Fabric, it’s essential to establish a strong Data Governance program.
