<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When I started developing software at thirteen I dreamed of architecting big software systems.<br>

I really wanted to build cool stuff with my computer, although I could only program a little bit<br>
of QBasic back then.</p>

<p>18 years later I am building big systems, but I haven't exactly reached my goal. Of course I<br>
design my fair share of big pieces of architectures, but I'm not an architect.</p>
<p>Here's why. Quickly after I discovered programming I also discovered my love for doing new things.<br>
I have a bad habit of stopping right before something becomes mainstream. The sort of thing you<br>
don't want in an architect to be honest.</p>
<p>This property of finding out new stuff and stopping before it becomes mainstream is a useful<br>
property if you know how to apply it though.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about it, I made sure to use this property to my advantage by becoming<br>
a technical evangelist. Yes, it's a thing and you may be wondering what that is, so let me explain what I do.</p>

<h2 id="tryoutnewideasbutnotbecauseyoucan">Try out new ideas, but not because you can</h2>
<p>I love new stuff and I am pretty handy when it comes to learning new things. I have no trouble<br>
diving into a new language or framework. My teammates are frequently worried about me and my experiments.</p>
<p>I tend to come up with at least a few new ideas every few hours or days depending on how busy I am<br>
doing other stuff.</p>
<p>All these new ideas sometimes lead to comments like &quot;No, you're not going to try this on our<br>
production server!&quot;</p>
<p>Lucky enough for my teammates, most of the ideas I have never make it to production. I can't help myself<br>
I have to try new things and talk about them, throw them against the ideas of others to see what sticks.<br>
This helps me figure out what I should convince other people to use and what I should write or talk about.</p>
<p>I keep trying things out. Experiment with new languages, frameworks and techniques.<br>
Some examples I've build about 20 times before I was happy with the results. And maybe if I try<br>
another time it will get even better.</p>
<p>My goal as a technical evangelist is to try as many things as I can in the areas I find fun.<br>
This way I discover what works and what doesn't work.</p>
<h2 id="helpoutwhereveryoucantolearn">Help out wherever you can to learn</h2>
<p>But technical evangelism is not just about trying new things and talking about them.<br>
You learn a lot about technology when you help others on their projects.</p>
<p>When I help someone I learn new things. For starters I learn how other developers use technology.<br>
I also learn a lot about how they think. This is important for me, because if I want to change<br>
my portion of the world I need to know how.</p>
<p>When you know how people think about certain aspects of IT, you know how to approach their problems.<br>
This helps me as a technical evangelist to approach the people in the right way, so they understand<br>
my ideas and how I can help them get better at what they do.</p>
<h2 id="andthentalkaboutit">And then talk about it</h2>
<p>As you help people they get to know you and when you have a new idea they are the audience<br>
that will listen to your wild ideas and know what they mean to them. Because talking about your ideas<br>
is the best way to change that little spot in the universe you're in.</p>
<p>You can do this by writing blogposts, giving talks during conferences, writing articles in magazines,<br>
recording videos etc.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal here is to help people along however I can. This means I need to share as much<br>
of the knowledge and ideas I carry around in my head.</p>
<h2 id="thisallsoundsverymetawhyshouldicare">This all sounds very meta, why should I care?</h2>
<p>You may be wondering, what this has to do with your job and why such a thing as technical evangelist exists.<br>
I mean, trying out things and talking about them costs money and my boss doesn't earn a penny for it.</p>
<p>You can use my brain to get new ideas for your project. It saves you a lot of time when you do that!<br>
There's nothing worse then being stuck on a problem without getting help. Call me, text me, whatsapp me, twitter me.</p>
<p>I love to hear about your problem, puzzle, idea and maybe I can help you get things done quicker by adding some<br>
of my ideas in the mix.</p>
<p>Also, I hope to inspire you to do things you've never done before. I think it keeps developers happy to try<br>
something new from time to time. And I bring the added bonus of having run into many problems so you don't have to.</p>
