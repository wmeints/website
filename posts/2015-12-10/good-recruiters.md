<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Every week I get at least 3 questions whether I'd like to change jobs. It usually goes something like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Hi we are looking for developers for a company somewhere in the country.<br>
Tt's really great, they are the most fun to work with. The do<br>
projects for big companies.&quot;</p>
<p>That my friends doesn't tell me anything. Of course the company is the best around, of course the projects<br>
are exciting. And surely they pay well. But ehm, who do I work for? What customers? What projects exactly?</p>

<h2 id="thebadandevenworse">The bad and even worse</h2>
<p>It's outraging to see how bad the recruitment business has gotten. They won't tell you which company you're<br>
actually submitting your resume for. Because the person that asks you is afraid that you might go over their heads<br>
and talk to the company yourself.</p>
<p>Also, the recruiter will not talk to you about the interesting projects the company is doing, because he/she doesn't know.<br>
Every once in a while I do a test and ask them about the company they recruit for and the projects they do. So far 100%<br>
of the people I talked to couldn't tell me.</p>
<p>What's even worse, they typically demand your resume as fast as possible. And believe me, they won't take no for an<br>
answer straight away. I usually resort to the &quot;I don't deal with recruiters anymore, remove me from your database.&quot;<br>
And even that doesn't always help.</p>
<p>All in all, I think that the business of recruiting people has gotten out of hand. There's way too much money<br>
involved in the business. More and more recruiters start to care less about who they talk to as long as they get<br>
the 1/3 year salary for that one person.</p>
<h2 id="arentthereanygoodrecruitersaround">Aren't there any good recruiters around?</h2>
<p>So LinkedIn is filled with bad recruiters. It made me wonder whether there are any good recruiters left.<br>
Turns out there are, but you don't see those very often on LinkedIn. Here's why:</p>
<p>A good recruiter doesn't contact you if you say on your profile that you aren't interested.<br>
This means they won't make any money from you. But it also means that you are left alone just like you<br>
wanted. It's called politeness.</p>
<p>Speaking of politeness, a good recruiter doesn't ask you for your resume straight away. First let me<br>
talk to you and find out if I'm really interested. The resume is only important if I want to go ahead<br>
and talk to the company about getting a job there. A good recruiter knows this and is interested in me.<br>
Not the head with the two hands who knows how to control the computer, but the person that also likes<br>
to work at a place where there's room for more than just work.</p>
<p>Also, a good recruiter tells me plenty about the company that he/she is recruiting for. And here's why:<br>
He/she has made a contract with the company to recruit for them and isn't afraid you go over their heads<br>
directly to the company itself. That's because the company will refer you back to the recruiter.</p>
<p>Finally, a good recruiter goes all the way. He/she will guide you through the process of getting a new job.<br>
Starting with the wishes you have, optimizing your resume and finally contacting you after to find out if<br>
you're happy with the new job. After all, a recruiter needs to earn a living, so he better do everything<br>
to get you the job you like.</p>
<h2 id="sometips">Some tips</h2>
<p>There's a really big gap between a good and a bad recruiter that's for sure. I have no idea how this<br>
happened, but I guess we have to deal with the current state. So here's a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that when you talk to a recruiter you know for sure that they have a contract with the<br>
company they are recruiting for. Things tend to go very bad if they don't. Not for them, but for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If things sound fishy, don't hesitate to push harder for answers. If it still feels bad after this, stop.<br>
Don't waste your time on recruiters that make a mess of things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay polite. A good reputation as a developer is worth its weight in gold. Don't waste it.<br>
Be clear about where you want to go, but stay calm friendly. After all kindness goes a long way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do happen to look for a new job, make sure that your LinkedIn status says so. Check the settings<br>
on your profile so that the good recruiters know where to find you. The same goes for the other way around.<br>
Not looking for a job? Set your status accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's loads more tips I could give you, but generally speaking: Try to ignore the bad recruiters and when in doubt check.<br>
Be sure to stay nice since that is all you have, your good reputation and friendliness no matter how good you are.</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I still have good hope that one day the recruitment business will calm down a bit and people will start to learn<br>
that it takes more than mass emails to get the right people for the job.</p>
<p>If after all you're fed up with the recruitment business, consider deleting your LinkedIn account. Let's be honest here,<br>
it's only for the recruitment business anyways...</p>
