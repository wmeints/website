<p>I've always been a huge fan of mechanical keyboards. Personally I use the daskeyboard mechanical keyboard. It's a clicky, loud typing beast. Great for writing books and blogposts and occasional programming when I get to it. But I want something different. I decided to build an Iris custom keyboard.</p><h2 id="why-build-your-own-keyboard">Why build your own keyboard?</h2><p>The big question is, why would you ever build your own keyboard? There are so many good choices available! Yes there are and I would suggest that you try a standard one first. They are much cheaper than building your own.</p><p>Building a custom keyboard is pretty expensive. Most likely you will end up spending 200 euros to get a good one. The fun for me is in building one. </p><p>I've recently picked up the soldering iron again. I started working on some smaller projects with my Raspberry Pi and a couple of arduinos. My wife and I are working on a robot car. 3D printing parts and soldering up cameras, sensors and what-not.</p><p>Building something electronic sparked an old love for building hardware. And as soon as a colleague of mine showed me his blog on custom keyboards, I decided I wanted to build one myself.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-iris-keyboard">What is an Iris keyboard?</h2><p>So while I was reading his blog I wondered, what kind of keyboard do I want. I definitely wanted something ergonomic. A split keyboard is an excellent choice for a more ergonomic typing experience.</p><p>There's a couple of DIY mechanical keyboards that fit my criteria. For example:</p><ul><li>Ergodox: <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">https://ergodox-ez.com/</a></li><li>Iris: <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard">https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard</a></li><li>Let's split: <a href="https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide">https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide</a></li><li>Helidox: <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/">https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/</a></li></ul><p>They all look fantastic. Some of them are harder to get parts for than others though. So be sure to look around the internet for a good webshop to order the parts from.</p><p>I went with the iris keyboard because it is the one that is the easiest to get in the Netherlands. Also, I kind of like the layout and lighting options on that one.</p><h2 id="getting-the-parts">Getting the parts</h2><p>The iris keyboard is sold by keeb.io and candykeys. You need several things to build a fully functional keyboard. </p><p>It all starts with the <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard?variant=8034004860958">Iris PCB kit</a>. A set of PCB boards to which you have to solder the keyboard switches and some other components. The kit includes the following:</p><ul><li>A set of PCB plates for the keyboard (left hand and right hand)</li><li>A set of diodes for the switches </li><li>A cable to connect the two halves together</li><li>Two connectors for the cable</li><li>Two reset buttons so you can flash the microcontrollers on the keyboard</li></ul><p>Additionally you will need to order the following extra parts:</p><ul><li>56 keycaps, be sure to get ones for an orthogonal layout</li><li>Micro-USB cable suitable for data and power</li><li>2x <a href="https://candykeys.com/product/pro-micro-5v-16mhz">Arduino pro micro controllers</a></li><li><a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-case-plates?variant=15461422006366">Plates to house your keyboard</a></li></ul><p>If you want to add lighting to your keyboard you need to get the following parts:</p><ul><li><a href="https://keeb.io/products/led-support-components-add-on?variant=8112255107178">The LED Support kit</a> (2x 4,7K ohm resistor and 2x AO3416 MOSFET)</li><li><a href="https://keeb.io/products/resistors?variant=6794645176350">60x 470 ohm resistors and SMD LEDs (0805 package)</a>.</li></ul><p>I personally didn't get the lighting kit through a webshop but bought them from a local electronics supplier. It's much cheaper that way.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>Full disclosure, I didn't receive all the parts yet, so I can't say anything about the build itself. Hopefully the stuff arrives soon so I can start building!</p><p>Stay tuned for more soldering and fixing action soon.</p>
